# Sentiment_Analysis_of_Climate_Data
With growing global concerns around the devastating effects of climate change and global warming, this project is aimed at classifying tweeter data inorder to comprehend the sentiment/perception of the sampled audience about climate change. 

The classification set out with importing necessary python libraries and classes. This was closely followed with loading the train, test and sample datasets. 

A sentiment analysis project using Natural Language Processing (NLP) to classify tweet data in order to understand the sentiment and perception of people about climate change.

The code is a Python script that performs sentiment analysis on textual data. The script uses the Pandas library to load and preprocess the training and test data, and the NLTK library to tokenize the text and remove stop words. It also uses the Scikit-learn library to convert the text data into numerical features using a bag of words model, and to train a logistic regression model to predict the sentiment of the text.
